# Todo-React-App

This application was implemented for the module "Software Quality" from the corporate state university of baden-w√ºrttemberg. 

We had to do a presentation about the topic "Tools for automated GUI-Testing", and to demonstrate script-based testing, record & playback testing and visual testing, we created this project.

The testing was done with react-testing-library, cypress and katalon studio.


## App

First run npm install, to install needed packages.

To run the app it self, run npm start.

To run the react-testing-library tests, run npm test.

To open cypress run npx cypress open.
